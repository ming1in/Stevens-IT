*** Continuous Integration(Waterfall) ***
- everyone integrates together

- integration testing happens all at once

- follows rigid process

*** Continuous Integration(Agile) ***
- each individual integrate and test on their pace

- CI flow 
  - code repo w/ automated tests-> CI build tools -> build and test results

- Best Practices
  - maintain a single source code repo, keep everything needed to build in the repo * 

  - automate the build process and testing of new builds

  - frequent code commits from all developers
    - at least daily if not more frequent

  - build and test in development environment

  - fix build problems quickly

  - make it easy for everyone to get latest build

- Benefits
  - reduced risk

  - detect and fix bugs quickly and easily

  - relatively little new, untested code at any given time

  - developers fix bugs when code is fresh in their minds

  - enable Continuous delivery to customers

  - fewer bugs associated with automated testing

- Tools: Travis CI, Jenkins, TeamCity, Bamboo
