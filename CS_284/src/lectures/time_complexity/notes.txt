*** Linear Growth Rate ***
- T(n), denotes the unit of time an algorithm consumes relative to the size of the input(n)
- Does not take into account hardware being used to run the program
- T(n) belong to a greater class of function O(n)

*** Table Notation ***
The goal of Table Notation is to keep count of the total amount of operation(x)
given an input(i)

i = input
x = time complexity of operation with input(i)

i | x
