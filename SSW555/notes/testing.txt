*** Software Testing ***
  - The goal of software testing is to determine if the implementation
  if the implementation meets its specifications

  - Testing identifies problems -> debugging fixes problems

  - In waterfall method, testing is done at the end
  - In agile, testing is done throughout development

*** Traditional Testing Process ***
1) Unit Testing
  - ensures that recently implemented changes work
  - Who: Developers
  - What: New features, code, branches coverage
  - When: after code is completed and before integration
2) Integration Test
  - ensures that new components work with other components written by other 
   developers and can be cleanly integrated
  - Who: Developers, Testers
  - What: Test multiple modules from different developers
  - When: after unit test is completed on relevant modules
3) Regression Test
  - verify that changes have not introduced new bug after being released
  - Who: Testers
  - What: Integrated modules
  - When: after changes to code for bug fixes and integration
4) System Testing
  - ensures that complete system is complete
  - may include functionality, performance, and stress testing, etc.
  - Who: System Test Team(not developers)
  - What: Test complete system, performance & security, and stress testing
  - When: after all code is completed and tested
5) User Acceptance Test
  - customer verifies that the system performs as expected and meets requirements
  - Who: Customer test engineers
  - What: complete system based on requirements
  - When: After system testing, before final payment

*** Traditional Testing Gates ***
  - process of testing where if a testing process fails then the testing process is 
    restarted

*** When to integrate? ***
  - in agile method, integration is done more frequently(daily or every code commit)
  - in traditional methods, integration is more scarcely(weekly or after all code completion)

*** Agile Testing Process ***
  - Agile testing is very similar to traditional testing methods, however the 
    biggest difference is that ONLY DEVELOPERS test the code base.
  - Developers use automated testing platforms with tests written before code
    is written
  - Acceptance testing is done at the end of sprint during sprint review with
    product owners and stakeholders. Testing is done to systems and code 
    written in the prior sprint

*** Test Driven Development ***
  - test is written first
  - test is ran throughout development
  - code is good once all test cases are done
  - write some test, write some code, then repeat
